- 👋 Hi, I’m @CalvinPreston
- 👀 I’m interested in astrophysics, being my main focus for my BA and MSci degrees at Cambridge. Performing astrophyiscal simulations is the main way my research is produced!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, C++, MATLAB and FORTRAN coding languages (am confident in most but always more to learn!)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any astrophysical simulations (specifically early universe cosmology and formation of structure in the early universe!
